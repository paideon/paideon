// The closed set of public page keys (F-052). One PageRegistry entry exists
// per key, in registry/page-registry/.
//
// This file used to also hold PageDefinitionSchema, a serializable
// path+seo+sections shape with zero consumers anywhere in the codebase — it
// was the old PageConfig model, which the Feature Registry (F-052) already
// says was "removed entirely rather than deferred." It just hadn't actually
// been removed from here yet.
