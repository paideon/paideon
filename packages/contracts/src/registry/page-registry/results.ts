// Page registry for: Results. Also not in docs/Design System/Page
// Specifications.md's 12 written sections, same gap as events.ts — but
// confirmed real by the Feature Registry (F-051, F-052) and PAGE_KEY_VALUES.
// This is the aggregate O/L and A/L results page — island rank, subject
// pass rates, stream performance, never individual student grades (see
// domains/results/ol-aggregate-statistics.ts's own header note). Distinct
// from the Academics page's small manual stats strip, which has no live
// results feed behind it at all.
