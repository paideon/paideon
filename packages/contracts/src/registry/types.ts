//
// The runtime shape every page-registry file is built from (F-052). A
// PageRegistry pairs each section with its live, importable block schema —
// not a serializable string reference — because the registry's whole job is
// letting the admin panel render a dynamic form and validate a submission
// against the real Zod schema for that section, in one step.
//
// This file was referenced by every page-registry file from the start but
// never actually created — every one of them failed to compile as a result.
